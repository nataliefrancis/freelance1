For my freelance, I chose to work with a friend from Alaska. She has a side business in which she makes succulent plant decor from antique objects. She asked me weeks ago if I'd make her a web page so this is my starting attempt at that.

### Notes from my conversation with Michaela
1. Wants something simple that she can maintain herself. (We spoke about wordpress and she is interested in it)
2. She has a logo she will supply to me.
3. Wants plant and earthy colors.
4. Wants to allow for people to purchase online, but she will only be doing deliveries; no shipping.
5. I suggested a calendar of events she will be at so that people can find her in person.
6. Doesn't want many (if any) animations. She has simple tastes for now. Her main priority will be displaying her creations for people to browse. She wants that to be the focal point.
7. Other than that, she had no ideas of what she wants and asked me to take liberties where I saw fit.

I might consider making it a single page web site in which the main nav bar would just direct the user to a place further down the page. Though it needs to have a shopping cart so that will add at least one additional page. I have started perusing wordpress templates.

#### List of Wordpress themes I could use:
1. FashionPoint
2. Type
3. SShop
4. Bakes and Cakes
5. Brasserie
6. Pinnacle
7. Effect
